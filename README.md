# Blog Api (Frontend)

This is a frontend of my blog which i created with `react`. React is really a cool **library** to make `javascript` projects and it's really fun. You just create a components you need and you compose it to make a fullfledged javascript web app.

I used [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for user interface.

This blog has the features which consists of
* User can view blogs posted by owner of the blog
* user can comment on the post
* user can edit and remove the posted comment unless it is not deleted by owner of the post.
* user can toggle between dark and light theme ðŸ˜‰
